**Project 1: Evaluating Voter Data**

In the PyPoll_Main.py file, the program reviews more than 3.5 million votes to:
* Find the total number of votes cast
* See who are the candidates that received votes, plus the percentage of as well as number of votes received per candidate
* Determine winning candidate
* Export results to a text file

**Project 2: Evaluating Monthly P/L**

In the PyBank_Main.py file, the program reviews profit/loss data to:
* Find the total number of months reviewed
* See the total net (i.e., gross net) for all months 
* Determine the average monthly change in net
* Parse the month and amount for the best increase--and on the flip side, the worst decrease 
* Export results to a text file
