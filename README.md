In the PyPoll_Main.py file, the program goes through over 3.5 million votes to deliver:
* Final tally of all votes cast
* List of candidates as well as the percentage of votes received and the actual number of votes received
* Determines the winner
* Exports all results to a text file

**Project 2: PyBank--Evaluating Monthly P/L**

In the PyBank_Main.py file, the program reviews budget data to deliver:
* Total number of months reviewed
* Total Net (i.e., gross net) for all months 
* Average monthly change in net
* Month and amount for the best increase within this data set
* Month and amount for the worst decrease within this data set
